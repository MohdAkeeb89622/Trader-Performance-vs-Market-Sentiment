ACTIONABLE STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment Analysis
======================================================================


STRATEGY 1: CONTRARIAN VOLUME APPROACH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Observation: High-volume traders perform BETTER during Fear days 
  (Avg PnL: $340702.55) vs Greed days ($102464.27)

Recommendation: 
  • INCREASE position sizes during Fear periods (when index < 40)
  • REDUCE position sizes during Greed periods (when index > 60)
  • High-volume traders should be more aggressive during market fear
  
Rationale: Counter-intuitive result suggests high-volume traders 
capitalize on fear-driven volatility and discounted entry points.


STRATEGY 2: SENTIMENT-ADAPTIVE TRADING FREQUENCY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Observation: 
  • Long ratio during Fear: 45.9%
  • Long ratio during Greed: 49.4%
  • Trade frequency changes across sentiment regimes

Recommendation:
  • During FEAR days: 
    - Reduce trading frequency by 20-30%
    - Focus on higher-conviction trades only
    - Consider increasing short exposure if long ratio > 55%
    
  • During GREED days:
    - Maintain normal trading frequency
    - Slight long bias acceptable (up to 60%)
    - Set tighter stop-losses due to potential reversals
    
Rationale: Fear periods show higher volatility and less predictable
outcomes. Reducing frequency during fear preserves capital while 
maintaining exposure to high-probability setups.
